# Glam Squad

## Introduction
Welcome to Glam Squad, our Makeup Brand Search App! This application was developed as part of a stretch tech project during Module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. As a team of four developers, we took on the challenge of learning and implementing TypeScript for this project.

Glam Squad is a user-friendly platform that allows users to easily search for their favorite makeup brands. Throughout the development process, we took the opportunity to teach ourselves TypeScript.

Our app provides a comprehensive database that includes a wide range of makeup brands, ensuring that users can find information on both popular and niche brands.In addition to brand search functionality, Glam Squad offers detailed information about each selected product, such as product pricing, rating, and product image. We aimed to create a clean and intuitive user interface that allows for a seamless browsing experience.

We are proud of the progress we made during this stretch tech project, both in terms of building the Glam Squad app and expanding our skills with TypeScript. We hope you enjoy using Glam Squad as much as we enjoyed developing it as a team. Happy makeup brand searching!

## Context 
Building Glam Squad with a team of four developers was an exhilarating and collaborative journey. We leveraged the power of TypeScript, React, Cypress, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a remarkable app that caters to makeup enthusiasts.

TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, provided us with enhanced tooling and improved code maintainability throughout the development process. React, a popular JavaScript library, served as the foundation for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience for our users.

JavaScript, being the backbone of web development, allowed us to add functionality and interactivity to Glam Squad, making it engaging and user-friendly. With HTML and CSS, we crafted visually appealing and well-structured web pages, guaranteeing a seamless user experience and an attractive design.

To ensure the app's quality and reliability, we integrated Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework. Cypress enabled us to write automated tests, ensuring the flawless functionality of Glam Squad across different browsers and devices.

Collaborating as a team brought numerous benefits to the app development process. By sharing ideas, dividing tasks, and leveraging each other's strengths, we created a well-rounded and polished app. Effective communication and teamwork were essential in combining these technologies to exceed user expectations and deliver an outstanding experience with Glam Squad.
